`puller_cache` is a repository holding cached forest data that was obtained from public sources online. It is to be used with the `forest_puller` python package which is hosted here:

https://github.com/xapple/forest_puller

Briefly, in order to avoid web scraping each data source over again every time a new user installs the `forest_puller` package, we have revision controlled some of the smaller files for immediate access.
